# Doctor---Patient-Scheduler
Python is used to create this simple hospital appointment system project. A Python script is included in the project file (appointment.py, update.py, display.py). This is a straightforward GUI-based application that is simple to grasp and apply. The Tkinter module provides the GUI. When it comes to the application, patients can easily book, view, update, and cancel appointments.
Each day, the doctor assigns slots to patients, and they must select one. If a patient attempts to book an unavailable place, an exception will be raised, and trying to book slots on weekends will result in an error.
The design is so simple that the user will have no trouble working on it.
